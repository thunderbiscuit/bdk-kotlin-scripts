# BDK Scripts â€” Kotlin

This repos is a collection of scripts that can be launched from the command line and leverage the bitcoin development kit to accomplish simple (and not-so-simple) tasks.

They aim to be a starting point and reference for how to use the bdk-jvm library.

You can run any script from your command line given you have Kotlin installed using:

```shell
cd ./bdk-scripts-kotlin/
kotlin <script name>
```
